Life After Watson
===================================================================

<br>

**Life After Watson** is a reference and playbook. It draws most of its material from Project Watson, Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), and experience. I built this project to suit my own requirements, but I'm glad to accept additions.

- All articles are inside the `articles` directory.
- Each article is a markdown file.
- Images, attached files, etc. are stored in `articles/data`.
- Maintaining this file structure maintains internal relative links and enables one to clone the repo for offline use.
- Authored with Remarkable, a Linux/Windows Markdown editor with live preview and the ability to export into PDF.
